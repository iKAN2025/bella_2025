    "Purpose of the Algorithm\n",

It collects input from the user, checks eligibility conditions for each membership or discount, and then outputs the appropriate results.\n",

    "Explanation of Each if Condition\n",
    "Basic Membership Eligibility (if (age >= 18 && income >= 20000)):\n",
    "\n",
    "This checks if the user is at least 18 years old and has an annual income of $20,000 or more.\n",
    "If both conditions are met, the user qualifies for a \"Basic Membership.\"\n",
    "Premium Membership Eligibility (if (age >= 25 && income >= 50000)):\n",
    "\n",
    "This checks if the user is at least 25 years old and has an annual income of $50,000 or more.\n",
    "If both conditions are satisfied, the user qualifies for a \"Premium Membership.\"\n",
    "Student Discount Eligibility (if (isStudent)):\n",
    "\n",
    "This checks if the user is a student (determined by whether they answered \"yes\" to the prompt).\n",

    "\n",

    "Default Case (if (results.length === 0)):\n",

    "The user is 20 years old, which satisfies the age condition (age >= 18), but their income is $1,500, which is less than the required $20,000. Therefore, they do not qualify for Basic Membership.\n",

    "\n",
    "The user is 20 years old, which does not satisfy the age condition (age >= 25), and their income is also less than $50,000. So, they do not qualify for Premium Membership.\n",
