    "### Shell Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "During the installation process, I utilized various shell commands in the Terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`cd`**: This command was used to navigate between directories, allowing me to move into project folders or specific directories where the installation or configuration files were located.\n",
    "- **`git`**: I used Git commands extensively for version control. \n",
    "  - `git clone` was employed to copy repositories from GitHub to my local machine.\n",
    "  - Other commands like `git commit` were used to save changes, `git push` to upload changes back to GitHub, and `git pull` to sync my local repository with the remote one.\n",
    "- **`brew`**: On macOS, I used Homebrew to install necessary software packages. For instance, installing Python or other dependencies needed for the project.\n",
    "- **`python`**: The `python --version` command helped verify that Python was installed correctly. I also used Python commands to run scripts and check for the correct functioning of installed packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control was a key part of the setup process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cloning Repositories**: I cloned repositories from GitHub to my local machine using the `git clone` command. This placed all the files in a directory on my computer, which I accessed using the `cd` command.\n",
    "- **Navigating and Updating Files**: After making changes to the files locally, I used `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to stage, commit, and push these changes back to GitHub. I navigated to these files using the Terminal.\n",
    "- **Updating the Portfolio Template**: To update the `portfolio_2025` repository, I would pull the latest changes, edit the files to reflect my course requirements, and push the updated version to my GitHub repository. For example, I added some of the blogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Localhost vs. Deployed Server\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the difference between localhost and a deployed server is crucial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Localhost**: The localhost URL (`http://localhost:<port_number>`) allows me to view and test my project on my machine. This URL is not accessible to others; it’s used for development and testing purposes.\n",
    "- **Deployed Server (GitHub Pages)**: The deployed version of my project is accessible at a public URL provided by GitHub Pages, such as [https://ikan2025.github.io/student_2025/](https://ikan2025.github.io/student_2025/). Anyone with this link can view the site.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DNS and GitHub Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS (Domain Name System) plays a role in how my GitHub Pages site is accessed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Domain**: Currently, my GitHub Pages does not have a custom domain. The URL provided is based on my GitHub username and repository name.\n",
    "- **Unique URL**: My GitHub Pages URL is unique and differs from others due to the combination of my GitHub username and the repository name. I haven’t changed the URL, but I could set up a custom domain if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "For verifying tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tool Installation**: I ensured that tools like Python, Git, Ruby, and others were installed correctly by running their version commands (e.g., `git --version`, `python --version`).\n",
    "- **Basic Command Execution**: I ran basic commands for each tool to check their functionality. This confirmed that the installations were successful and the tools were working as expected.\n",
    "- **Issue Resolution**: I documented any issues encountered during the setup and the steps taken to resolve them, ensuring a smooth development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub Usage with VSCode\n",
    "\n",
    "Using GitHub in conjunction with VSCode became an integral part of my workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Commit**: I made frequent commits to save changes locally, ensuring that my work was always up-to-date and backed up.\n",
    "- **Push and Pull**: Regularly pushing updates to GitHub and pulling changes from the remote repository helped keep my project synchronized across different environments.\n",
    "- **GitLens Extension**: The GitLens extension in VSCode provided a clear view of the commit history, showing who made changes and when. It also highlighted the contributors to the project, making collaboration easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary for Pair Showcase\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Pair Showcase, I would summarize the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tools Verification**: I verified the installation and functionality of essential tools like Python, Git, and Ruby by executing version commands and running basic scripts. Any issues encountered were documented and resolved promptly.\n",
    "- **GitHub Usage**: I used GitHub with VSCode for version control, performing frequent commits, pushing updates, and pulling changes to keep the project in sync. The GitLens extension helped track the commit history and contributions, offering insights into the project’s development over time.\n",

    "## Tool Play with JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Use your tools installation to learn JavaScript, create dynamic web content, and understand that there are many ways to solve the same problem (coding styles).\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript Ideation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using ideas and hints from the Tool Play lesson, start the ideation process in Jupyter Notebooks to define your future `index.md` home page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideation in the course starts in Jupyter Notebooks. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create an HTML File**: Start with an HTML file that includes a container element.\n",
    "2. **Enhance with CSS**: Use CSS to style your HTML elements.\n",
    "3. **Modify with JavaScript**: Use JavaScript to dynamically modify content within the HTML container.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vocabulary Note**: Modifying an HTML container is often referred to as modifying the DOM (Document Object Model). The term \"DOM\" will be used frequently in the course and is associated with the \"document.\" prefix used in commands like `document.createElement`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update `index.md` Home Page\n",
    "\n",
    "Transition from ideation to designing your own home pages. As you work with your pair, you should learn similar coding styles, but your end product should be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integrate JavaScript**: Incorporate your JavaScript code into your GitHub Pages project.\n",
    "2. **Verify Display**: Ensure that the dynamic content is displayed correctly on both localhost and the deployed server.\n",
    "3. **Document Challenges**: Blog about any challenges faced and how you overcame them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare a 2-Minute Summary on Your `index.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Demo the Pages**: Show the live pages on both localhost and the deployed server.\n",
    "2. **Show the Code**: Walk through the JavaScript code that modifies the DOM.\n",
    "3. **Jupyter Ideation Process**: Explain the ideation process documented in your Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "4. **Coding Style Question**: Be prepared to answer the question, \"How could you use another coding style to change your loop?\" For example, if you used a `for` loop, explain how you could use `forEach` or another iteration method.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing these \"Hacks,\" you will gain a deeper understanding of the tools and processes involved in setting up and managing a development environment, verifying tool installations, and applying JavaScript to create dynamic web content.\n",
