    "## Installation Hack\n",
    "\n",
    "It is fundamental that you learn how to create your own blogging website and understand the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shell Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Take note and describe the type of shell commands you are using through Terminal in this installation procedure.** This is specific to your machine.\n",
    "  - Examples: `wsl`, `cd`, `git`, `apt`, `brew`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Shell Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "During the installation procedure, you might use a variety of shell commands specific to your machine's operating system and environment. Here's a description of some common shell commands you may encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `cd` (Change Directory)\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Navigates between directories in your file system.\n",
    "   - **Example Usage:** `cd Documents/Projects` moves you to the \"Projects\" folder within the \"Documents\" directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `git`\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Manages Git repositories, allows for version control, and facilitates collaboration.\n",
    "   - **Example Usage:** \n",
    "     - `git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git` clones a repository to your local machine.\n",
    "     - `git commit -m \"Initial commit\"` commits changes to the local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. `brew`\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Manages packages on macOS (and Linux) through the Homebrew package manager.\n",
    "   - **Example Usage:** `brew install git` installs Git, and `brew update` updates Homebrew itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. `sudo`\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Executes commands with superuser (admin) privileges.\n",
    "   - **Example Usage:** `sudo apt install python3` installs Python 3 with admin privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. `mkdir` (Make Directory)\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Creates a new directory.\n",
    "   - **Example Usage:** `mkdir new_project` creates a new folder named \"new_project.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. `ls`\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Lists files and directories within the current directory.\n",
    "   - **Example Usage:** `ls -la` lists all files, including hidden ones, with detailed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. `pwd` (Print Working Directory)\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Displays the full path of the current directory.\n",
    "   - **Example Usage:** Simply typing `pwd` will show where you are in the file system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. `rm` (Remove)\n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Deletes files or directories.\n",
    "    - **Example Usage:** `rm file.txt` deletes the file \"file.txt,\" while `rm -r directory_name` deletes a directory and its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. `cp` (Copy)\n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Copies files or directories.\n",
    "    - **Example Usage:** `cp file.txt /backup/` copies \"file.txt\" to the \"/backup/\" directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. `mv` (Move)\n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Moves or renames files or directories.\n",
    "    - **Example Usage:** `mv old_name.txt new_name.txt` renames the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. `echo`\n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Displays a line of text or variables.\n",
    "    - **Example Usage:** `echo \"Hello, World!\"` prints \"Hello, World!\" to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "These commands are essential for navigating your file system, managing software, and version control during the installation process.\n",
