    "## Sprint 1\n",
    "In sprint 1, I customized my home page, experimented with code, and familiarized myself with tools.  I made a shell script to automate tools setup for my computer and made an alias to create a virtual environment. I also worked more with sass to change my theme. I also added a cool about me page :).  I learned how to work with my pair, Trystan, and got to learn a little about my team.\n",

    "## Sprint 2\n",
    "In Sprint 2, I learned the fundamentals of Java with programming and created mini-projects in Java to supplement my learning. I had fun working with graphics and learning a language. I also taught inheritance,  one of the most complex lessons we had in out team teaches. I also created a [homework blog]({{site.baseurl}}/csa/Homework) and an issue to capture feedback. Here, I got to know my team a little more.\n",

    "## Sprint 3\n",
    "In Sprint 3, I learned how to work with an entirely new framework: Spring :). Since I knew my team a little more, it was easier to set roles. We ran in to a lot of issues, but we still got started on recreating features like login, profile, and sign up flask. \n",
