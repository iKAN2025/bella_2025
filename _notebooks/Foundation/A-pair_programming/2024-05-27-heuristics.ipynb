    " **A\\*** considers both: The **cost so far** from the start to the current node (`g(n)`), and A **heuristic estimate** of the remaining distance to the goal (`h(n)`). This ensures A\\* finds the **shortest possible path** efficiently, **guaranteed**, if the heuristic is admissible (e.g. Manhattan distance in a grid). Since Greedy Best-First Search **only uses the heuristic** (`h(n)`) to guide its path, it could get stuck in a loop trying to find the best solution, Because it **ignores the cost so far** (`g(n)`), which can lead it down **longer or inefficient paths**. It may find a solution faster in some cases but is **not guaranteed** to find the shortest one.\n",

    "A\\* is preferred because it combines both the **actual cost so far (`g(n)`)** and the **estimated cost to the goal (`h(n)`)**, which ensures it finds the **shortest path** if the heuristic is admissible. In contrast, Greedy Best-First Search only uses the heuristic and may take suboptimal paths, making it **faster but not always correct**.\n",
