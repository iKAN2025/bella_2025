That's definelty not multiples of 4! Some of them skipped multiples (multiplying by 4 after each increment! That's exponential!)\n",

Then, as j < k, the jth element is replaced with the k'th elemnt. So the first time, the first and last are swapped, Then as k is subtracted by one and j is added by oone, the second and second-to-last is swapped, and so on and so forth until the list is REVERSED.
