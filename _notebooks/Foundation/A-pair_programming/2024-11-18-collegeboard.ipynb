    "This tic-tac-toe one took me a whopping 2 minutes and 50 seconds, which isn't ideal. Figuring out the first loop was pretty easy-the whole table is populated with Os. The next for loop starts val at 0 and increments by 1 until val is 4, when val is 5 the loop terminates. When val is 1, row is assigned 1 and col is assigned 0. The boolean condition in the while loop is true, so board[1][0] is assigned “X”. Then col is incremented to 1 and row is decremented to 0 and board[0][1] is assigned “X”. Then col is incremented to 2 and row is decremented to -1 and the while loop terminates. When val is 3, row is assigned 3 and col is assigned 0.

    "#  Tackling the Hailstone Sequence FRQ\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, I worked on a Java free-response question involving **hailstone sequences**—a type of mathematical pattern that eventually terminates at 1 using a specific set of rules. The FRQ required implementing three methods in a `Hailstone` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `hailstoneLength(int n)` – returns how many steps it takes for a hailstone sequence starting at `n` to reach 1.\n",
    "2. `isLongSeq(int n)` – determines whether a sequence is \"long\" (its length is greater than or equal to its starting value).\n",
    "3. `propLong(int n)` – calculates the proportion of long sequences among the first `n` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  My Initial Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "I started by coding `hailstoneLength`. Here's the logic: if the number is even, divide it by 2; if it's odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. I then count the steps until we hit 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s my first draft of that method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static int hailstoneLength(int n) {\n",
    "    int count = 0;\n",
    "    while (n != 1) {\n",
    "        if (n % 2 == 0) {\n",

    "        count++;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return count;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, this looked fine. But when I checked the expected length of the sequence for hailstoneLength(1), it returned 0, which is incorrect—it should return 1 because the sequence still starts with 1, even if it doesn't go anywhere."
