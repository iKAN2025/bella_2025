    "- Good interaction with audience members and excellent presentation skills.  \n",
    "- The website is very well designed and easy to operate.  \n",

    "- Secure login page implemented well using Java and Python.  \n",
    "- The system allows users to log in and retrieve saved data successfully.  \n",

    "- Include the database (`.db`) file in `.gitignore` to avoid security risks.  \n",
    "- Improve user interaction by clearing the email field after signing out.  \n",
    "- Autosave feature is buggy; consider removing or improving it.  \n",
    "- Update the CSS and front end to make it more visually appealing and align with the Nighthawk Pages style.  \n",
    "- Allow users to edit their own accounts securely (e.g., logged-in users can edit their profiles and no one elseâ€™s).  \n",
    "- Have the reset password on frontend, looks like trouble creating both accounts\n",
    "- Enable functionality for users to delete their accounts or change their passwords in the database.  \n",
