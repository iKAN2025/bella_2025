## STEM and Project-Based Learning
- **Importance of STEM**: STEM is huge, especially in tech cities like San Diego, where opportunities are abundant. Getting involved in projects early on gives you hands-on experience that matters more than grades in the long term.
- **Project-Based Learning**: Many panelists emphasize how working on projects during high school, such as **Science Olympiad**, **CyberPatriot**, and **internships**, shaped their technical skills. **Project-based learning (PBL)** not only develops skills but also boosts engagement and provides tangible results. Panelists, like **Vivian**, appreciated the satisfaction of having working projects.
  
## High School Preparation and Extracurricular Activities
- **Extracurriculars**:
  - **Science Olympiad**: A key extracurricular that helped in competition and learning.
  - **CyberPatriot**: A cybersecurity competition that taught how to secure systems, such as Windows and servers.
  - **Research and Internships**: Cold emailing for opportunities and internships, including at companies like **Northrop Grumman** for **Vivian**.
  - **LeetCode**: Engaging with platforms for coding challenges that helped improve technical skills.
  - **Club Involvement**: Many panelists joined technical clubs, like **CS Clubs**, and served in leadership positions to build communication and project management skills.
  
## College Admissions and Career Preparation
- **College Applications**:
  - Focus on **essays** discussing specific projects in **CSA** (Computer Science and Applications) and **CSP** (Computer Science Principles). Highlight **how and why** you want to be part of a specific program and how it aligns with your goals.
  - For **engineering and tech majors**, research the **major** and **professors** at your desired university. Understand what classes they offer and how they align with your career interests.
  - **Dual Enrollment**: Taking community college classes during high school helps accumulate credits and refresh knowledge when taking them again in college.

- **Interviews**:  
  - The format of **live reviews** in the panel was similar to actual **interviews**, emphasizing clear and concise communication, which is a key skill for success. Panelists highlighted how the ability to **talk clearly and stay on-topic** can set you apart.
  - **Communication** with recruiters is crucial; it's important to demonstrate your technical skills and articulate how you approach problems.

- **Engineering Tools**:  
  Panelists emphasized the importance of **CSA tools** like **flowcharts** and **methodologies** such as **Agile** in organizing and communicating ideas effectively. Understanding and using these tools gives you a significant edge in both school projects and professional settings.

## Personal Growth and Development
- **Learning from Experience**: Many panelists reflected on how they gained practical experience through **internships**, **club leadership**, and **project work**. For instance:
  - **Vivian** worked with a **team of engineers** at **Northrop Grumman** and participated in hackathons, where she honed both frontend and backend development skills.
  - **David** learned project management and design reviews through his role as **chief engineer of a solar racing team** and in his work with **simulation software**.
  
## Career and Industry Trends
- **Jobs Don't Care About GPA**: Employers look at the kinds of projects you've worked on and the **technical skills** you bring to the table, rather than just your GPA. Panelists agreed that a strong **portfolio** showcasing real-world experience is more important than grades.
- **Technical Skills**: Jobs in fields like **engineering** and **cybersecurity** focus on practical skills. For example, **Michael Hayes** talked about how he used tools like **Draw.io** for flowcharting and understood the technical implementation of energy systems.

## The Importance of Communication
- **Talking to Recruiters**: Effective communication during **live reviews** mirrors real-world job interviews, where the goal is to explain your thought process clearly. Panelists mentioned how discussing projects and **technical challenges** clearly and concisely helped them during their recruitment process.

## Technologies and Methodologies
- **Engineering Tools**: Panelists discussed using **Excel, Python, MATLAB**, and **Jupyter Notebooks** as part of their work in various engineering fields. They emphasized the importance of **explaining** how code works, rather than just focusing on whether it runs.
- **Flowcharts and Diagrams**: Creating **use case diagrams**, **flowcharts**, and utilizing methodologies like **Scrum** helped structure projects and communicate ideas effectively.

## Summary of Panelist Insights
1. **Passion for Projects**: Panelists stressed that high school is a great time to immerse yourself in STEM and work on projects that excite you. Whether it's **coding**, **engineering**, or **cybersecurity**, dive into hands-on learning.
2. **Communication Skills**: Mastering how to communicate effectively—especially through **interviews** and **live reviews**—is critical for success.
3. **Internships and Networking**: Actively seek internships and network with professionals. Building a portfolio of real-world projects is essential.
4. **STEM Opportunities**: Take advantage of **dual enrollment**, **community college classes**, and **internships** to prepare for college and career paths.
5. **Building a Portfolio**: A strong portfolio showcasing your work (such as websites, coding challenges, or engineering projects) is more valuable than simply focusing on grades.
